For me, herein lies an opportunity. These pages serve as an outlet for me to catalog, in written form, the shenanigans that take place in my home. I desperately need a place to talk about the things that I/we experience from day to day and since there are currently no support groups for thirty-something vintage-loving semi-hipster band-guy software-developing soon-to-be-first-time-father foodies, I figured that I would at least get the ball rolling.
